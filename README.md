Click the "Sign in with CILogon" button. On the following page, select CERN as your identity provider and click the "Log On" button. Then, enter your CERN credentials or use your CERN grid certificate to autheticate.

Now you should see the JupyterHub home directory. Click on "New" then "Terminal" in the top right to launch a new terminal.

To download the tutorials, type

```
git clone https://github.com/perilousapricot/pyROOTforCMSDAS
```

Now, in your directory tab, there should be a new directory called `pyROOTforCMSDAS`. All of the tutorials and exercises are in there.
